# Handwriting
This repository is to mintain an machine learning model capable of converting handwritten text into digital text, and vice-verca. 
The repo name is not yet final!!!

# Scope of this model
The objective of this repository is to develop a model which can convert handwritten text to digital text and vice-verca. It might not have any worldy impacts, but still, it will serve to benifit students from all over the globe as all their assignments and homework could be easily converted from digital text (copied from chat-gpt) to handwritten text that matches their handwriting! So, no more writing assignments!

# How to contribute to this repo
You can contribute to this repo by adding or improving any pre-existing model, adding dataset to improve model training, adding comments to help other contributors in understanding the code. Also while pulling request do make sure that you justify your changes and describe it properly. So, fork this repo and start contributing now!

# Structure of this repository
This repository consists of three branches.
0 -> Data
1 -> Model
2 -> Web Application

The Data branch will contain all the raw handwritten dataset, along with the processed dataset. The Model branch will contain all the components and notebook required for the neural network. And, finally the Web Application branch will contain the components for the web page and api for the application which is to be deployed!

# Tech Stack to be used
The Machine Learning model would mainly comprise of Python and Python libraires like: Panda, Numpy, Tensorflow, Keras, etc. For the web application part HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the website, and finally Flask for the API, are to be used.
